# Citi-Bike-Tableau

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

Data sets for the Tableau analysis are located in the link above. Periods used:
Q1 and Q3 for both 2017 and 2018.

Light data cleaning was done using Python Pandas. See code in the notebook attached.
